To enhance the PowerShell script so that it not only creates the users but also adds them to the "Remote Desktop Users" group, you can modify the script to include the `Add-LocalGroupMember` command for the "Remote Desktop Users" group. This group allows users to connect to the computer remotely, which can be useful if that's part of your user management requirements.

### Improved PowerShell Script

Here is the updated script:

```powershell
# Import user details from CSV file
$users = Import-Csv -Path "C:\Path\To\Your\users.csv"

# Loop through each user and create an account
foreach ($user in $users) {
    # Set username and password variables
    $username = $user.Username
    $password = ConvertTo-SecureString $user.Password -AsPlainText -Force

    # Check if the user already exists
    if (Get-LocalUser -Name $username -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
        Write-Output "User '$username' already exists. Skipping creation."
    } else {
        # Create new local user
        New-LocalUser -Name $username -Password $password -FullName $username -Description "Added by bulk script" -PasswordNeverExpires:$true

        Write-Output "User '$username' created successfully."
    }

    # Add user to the 'Users' group
    Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Users" -Member $username

    # Add user to the 'Remote Desktop Users' group
    Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Remote Desktop Users" -Member $username
}

Write-Output "User creation process completed."
```

### Key Improvements

1. **User Existence Check**: Before attempting to create a user, the script checks if a user with the same name already exists. This prevents errors from attempting to create a user that already exists and provides an informative message.

2. **Adding to "Remote Desktop Users" Group**: After creating the user, the script adds the user to both the "Users" group and the "Remote Desktop Users" group to grant remote desktop access.

### Additional Steps

- **Run the Script as Administrator**: Ensure you run PowerShell as an administrator, as creating users and modifying group memberships require elevated permissions.

- **Execution Policy**: As before, ensure the execution policy allows running scripts:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
  ```

### Running the Script

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Right-click the Start menu, select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Navigate to the script's directory or run it directly with the path:
   ```powershell
   .\YourScriptName.ps1
   ```

Replace `YourScriptName.ps1` with the name of your script file.

By incorporating these changes, the script now ensures users are added correctly and have the necessary permissions to connect remotely via Remote Desktop.
